## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting.
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/calendar-tracking-app.git
   cd calendar-tracking-app
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up your MongoDB connection in backend/config.js. If using MongoDB Atlas, replace the mongodb://localhost:27017/communication-tracking URL with your MongoDB Atlas connection string:

javascript
Copy code
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/communication-tracking', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the API URL in the frontend to match the backend server: In frontend/src/api.js, update the API_URL variable:

javascript
Copy code
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Connecting Backend and Frontend

The backend and frontend are connected via Axios for API requests.
Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running locally for proper communication.
The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch communication data, authenticate users, and manage tasks.

### Running the Application Locally

After setting up both the backend and frontend as described above:

Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application.

### Deployment Instructions

Backend Deployment (Heroku)
Create a new Heroku application:

bash
Copy code
heroku create
Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret) on Heroku.

Push the backend to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Ensure that the backend is running on a specific Heroku URL (e.g., https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com).

Frontend Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
Push the frontend to GitHub.

Link the GitHub repository to Netlify or Vercel for automatic deployment.

Set the frontend to fetch data from the live backend API URL (e.g., https://your-backend-app.herokuapp.com).

After deployment, you can access the app at the Netlify or Vercel provided URL.

## Application Functionality

Authentication: Users can register, login, and authenticate using JWT. The system supports role-based access control for Admin and User roles.
Communication Tracking: Users can add, edit, and delete communication logs.
Calendar Integration: The application displays communication events in a calendar view, making it easy to manage and visualize scheduled communications.
Notifications: The app sends notifications for overdue communications and upcoming tasks to ensure that no tasks are forgotten.
Reports: The system can generate communication logs in PDF and CSV formats for export.
Analytics: View detailed insights into communication trends, frequency, and effectiveness.

## Known Limitations

Limited Analytics: Currently, the analytics feature is basic and only includes basic metrics like communication frequency. Future updates will improve this with more advanced data visualization.
Timezone Handling: The calendar integration does not fully support time zone conversion. This might cause discrepancies when scheduling communications across different time zones.
Scalability: While the app is designed to handle a moderate amount of communication data, performance optimizations are needed for larger datasets or high-traffic applications.
User Roles: The role-based system is simple. Future updates may introduce more granular permissions and custom user roles.
Export Functionality: While PDF and CSV export is functional, future updates may include more customization options (e.g., selecting specific date ranges or communication types for reports).
